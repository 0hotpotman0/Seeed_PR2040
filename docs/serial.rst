Serial Ports (USB and UART)
===========================

The Arduino-Pico core implements a software-based Serial-over-USB port
using the USB ACM-CDC model to support a wide variety of operating
systems.

``Serial`` is the USB serial port, and while ``Serial.begin()`` does allow
specifying a baud rate, this rate is ignored since it is USB-based.
(Also be aware that this USB ``Serial`` port is responsible for resetting
the RP2040 during the upload process, following the Arduino standard
of 1200bps = reset to bootloader).

The RP2040 provides two hardware-based UARTS with configurable
pin selection.

``Serial1`` is ``UART0``, and ``Serial2`` is ``UART1``.

Configure their pins using the ``setXXX`` calls prior to calling ``begin()``

.. code:: cpp

        Serial1.setRX(pin);
        Serial1.setTX(pin);
        Serial1.begin(baud);
