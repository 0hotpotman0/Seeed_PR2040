Raspberry Pi Pico Arduino core, for all RP2040 boards

This is a port of the RP2040 (Raspberry Pi Pico processor) to the Arduino ecosystem. It uses the bare Raspberry Pi Pico SDK and a custom GCC 10.3/Newlib 4.0 toolchain.

* Adafruit ItsyBitsy RP2040
* Adafruit Macropad RP2040
* Adafruit QTPy RP2040
* Adafruit STEMMA Friend RP2040

* SparkFun ProMicro RP2040
* Generic (configurable flash, I/O pins)

# Installing via Arduino Boards Manager
**Windows Users**: Please do not use the Windows Store version of the actual Arduino application
because it has issues detecting attached Pico boards.  Use the "Windows ZIP" or plain "Windows"
executable (EXE)  download direct from https://arduino.cc. and allow it to install any device
drivers it suggests.  Otherwise the Pico board may not be detected.  Also, if trying out the
2.0 beta Arduino please install the release 1.8 version beforehand to ensure needed device drivers
are present.  (See #20 for more details.)

Open up the Arduino IDE and go to File->Preferences.

In the dialog that pops up, enter the following URL in the "Additional Boards Manager URLs" field:

https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico/releases/download/global/package_rp2040_index.json

Hit OK to close the dialog.

Go to Tools->Boards->Board Manager in the IDE

Type "pico" in the search box and select "Add":

# Installing via GIT
To install via GIT (for latest and greatest versions):
````
mkdir -p ~/Arduino/hardware/pico
git clone https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico.git ~/Arduino/hardware/pico/rp2040
cd ~/Arduino/hardware/pico/rp2040
git submodule update --init
cd pico-sdk
git submodule update --init
cd ../pico-extras
git submodule update --init
cd ../tools
python3 ./get.py
`````

# Installing both Arduino and CMake
Tom's Hardware presented a very nice writeup on installing `arduino-pico` on both Windows and Linux, available at https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/program-raspberry-pi-pico-with-arduino-ide

If you follow Les' step-by-step you will also have a fully functional `CMake`-based environment to build Pico apps on if you outgrow the Arduino ecosystem.

# Uploading Sketches
To upload your first sketch, you will need to hold the BOOTSEL button down while plugging in the Pico to your computer.
Then hit the upload button and the sketch should be transferred and start to run.

After the first upload, this should not be necessary as the `arduino-pico` core has auto-reset support. 
Select the appropriate serial port shown in the Arduino Tools->Port->Serial Port menu once (this setting will stick and does not need to be
touched for multiple uploads).   This selection allows the auto-reset tool to identify the proper device to reset.
Them hit the upload button and your sketch should upload and run.

In some cases the Pico will encounter a hard hang and its USB port will not respond to the auto-reset request.  Should this happen, just
follow the initial procedure of holding the BOOTSEL button down while plugging in the Pico to enter the ROM bootloader.

# Uploading Filesystem Images
The onboard flash filesystem for the Pico, LittleFS, lets you upload a filesystem image from the sketch directory for your sketch to use.  Download the needed plugin from
* https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico-littlefs-plugin/releases

To install, follow the directions in 
* https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico-littlefs-plugin/blob/master/README.md 

For detailed usage information, please check the ESP8266 repo documentation (ignore SPIFFS related notes) available at
* https://arduino-esp8266.readthedocs.io/en/latest/filesystem.html

# Uploading Sketches with Picoprobe
If you have built a Raspberry Pi Picoprobe, you can use OpenOCD to handle your sketch uploads and for debugging with GDB.

Under Windows a local admin user should be able to access the Picoprobe port automatically, but under Linux `udev` must be told about the device and to allow normal users access.

To set up user-level access to Picoprobes on Ubuntu (and other OSes which use `udev`):
````
echo 'SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="2e8a", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0004", GROUP="users", MODE="0666"' | sudo tee -a /etc/udev/rules.d/98-PicoProbe.rules
sudo udevadm control --reload
````

The first line creates a file with the USB vendor and ID of the Picoprobe and tells UDEV to give users full access to it.  The second causes `udev` to load this new rule.  Note that you will need to unplug and re-plug in your device the first time you create this file, to allow udev to make the device node properly.

Once Picoprobe permissions are set up properly, then select the board "Raspberry Pi Pico (Picoprobe)" in the Tools menu and upload as normal.

# Uploading Sketches with pico-debug
[pico-debug](https://github.com/majbthrd/pico-debug/) differs from Picoprobe in that pico-debug is a virtual debug pod that runs side-by-side on the same RP2040 that you run your code on; so, you only need one RP2040 board instead of two.  pico-debug also differs from Picoprobe in that pico-debug is standards-based; it uses the CMSIS-DAP protocol, which means even software not specially written for the Raspberry Pi Pico can support it.  pico-debug uses OpenOCD to handle your sketch uploads, and debugging can be accomplished with CMSIS-DAP capable debuggers including GDB.

Under Windows and macOS, any user should be able to access pico-debug automatically, but under Linux `udev` must be told about the device and to allow normal users access.

To set up user-level access to all CMSIS-DAP adapters on Ubuntu (and other OSes which use `udev`):
````
echo 'ATTRS{product}=="*CMSIS-DAP*", MODE="664", GROUP="plugdev"' | sudo tee -a /etc/udev/rules.d/98-CMSIS-DAP.rules
sudo udevadm control --reload
````

The first line creates a file that recognizes all CMSIS-DAP adapters and tells UDEV to give users full access to it.  The second causes `udev` to load this new rule.  Note that you will need to unplug and re-plug in your device the first time you create this file, to allow udev to make the device node properly.

Once CMSIS-DAP permissions are set up properly, then select the board "Raspberry Pi Pico (pico-debug)" in the Tools menu.

When first connecting the USB port to your PC, you must copy [pico-debug-gimmecache.uf2](https://github.com/majbthrd/pico-debug/releases/) to the Pi Pico to load pico-debug into RAM; after this, upload as normal.

# Debugging with Picoprobe/pico-debug, OpenOCD, and GDB
The installed tools include a version of OpenOCD (in the pqt-openocd directory) and GDB (in the pqt-gcc directory).  These may be used to run GDB in an interactive window as documented in the Pico Getting Started manuals from the Raspberry Pi Foundation.  For [pico-debug](https://github.com/majbthrd/pico-debug/), replace the raspberrypi-swd and picoprobe example OpenOCD arguments of "-f interface/raspberrypi-swd.cfg -f target/rp2040.cfg" or "-f interface/picoprobe.cfg -f target/rp2040.cfg" respectively in the Pico Getting Started manual with "-f board/pico-debug.cfg".
